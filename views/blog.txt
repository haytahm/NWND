okay,....
I already did the plan and the plan will be as fallow:

1- finish abu Rakan task and fingerprint task,
at the same time i should finish node js course then react course.
2- Make my own and first full website by using react and firebase for data base.
3- star Falcom website.

*Note:
 all that should be done before 7 pm 
 because after 7 pm all the rest of time will be for the online course AI.
